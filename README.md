This is a Project for the HTML module.  

The project is to illustrate and practice  HTML related skills I have acquired by building a basic recipe website.  

So far I have used the following skills and/or elements to build the website:  

* mkdir  
* mv, moving and renaming file  
* touch  
* boilerplate  
* h1  
* em  
* a href, absolute and relative links  
* img src  
* a  
* ul  
* ol  
* li
